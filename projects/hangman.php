                This is a game I created in Python to test my knowledge of Python. The game includes different lengths of words to guess as well as a sound that plays when you click a letter. It also stores how many games you have played and whether you won or lost the game and displays that after you win or lose. You can choose new words by pressing "new game" and you can restart your guesses by pressing "restart". There is also an easy to press "quit" button for visually impared.
