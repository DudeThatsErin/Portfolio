                This is a blog and website collective that I ran back in 2009 &amp; 2010 when I was 16 years old. This was my introduction to programming. I had assistance coding the theme from scratch for this collective. A collective was what we called website that stored a collection of links to other websites that one may own.
                <br />
                I would list my <a href="https://thefanlistings.org/" target="_blank" title="click here to read what fanlistings are">Fanlistings</a> and other websites on this website. I would also write blogs about my life.
