              Andrew Appleton (CEO and Founder) reached out to me to get his website maintained by me. I adapted the code he had to give him the website he desired. It was a unique experience that challenged me in a lot of different ways.<br />
              His website was already running WordPress. The previous developer skipped out on him without finishing the website. I had to make the theme compatible with WordPress and build the custom pages.<br />
              I started working with him in 2019 and am still working with him to this day. He has a few different websites I am working with him on like <a href="https://americanwarriors.com/" target="_blank">American Warriors</a>.
