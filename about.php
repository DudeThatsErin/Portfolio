            Hello! I'm Erin, a Full-Stack Software Engineer with a passion for creating efficient, user-friendly web applications 
            and building helpful tools for communities. I enjoy working with both front-end and back-end technologies, and I'm 
            constantly learning and adapting to new technologies.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Fast-forward to today, I have worked at multiple companies as a Full Stack Software Engineer. I got my start in my professional career working for River &amp; Reef Aquaculture as their Full Stack Software Engineer. But also, during my time as a freelance Full Stack Engineer before River &amp; Reef, I have developed websites and applications from scratch for clients like Travel Agent 360 and more.
