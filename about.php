            Hello! My name is Erin and I enjoy creating interactive bots and things that live on the internet. My interest is in bots and applying language learning models to them. I started about 9 years ago by creating a discord bot for my CodingHelp discord server that I authored. I have since started teaching myself how to apply language learning models to bots that I have created for websites and discord.

          <p>
            Fast-forward to today, I have worked at multiple companies as a Full Stack Software Engineer. I got my start in my professional career working for River &amp; Reef Aquaculture as their Full Stack Software Engineer. But also, during my time as a freelance Full Stack Engineer before River &amp; Reef, I have developed websites and applications from scratch for clients like Travel Agent 360 and more.
